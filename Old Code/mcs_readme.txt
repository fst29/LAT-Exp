Dear Malcolm,

I hope you are well.

I have started to write up the procedure that you can follow to run the experiment. I used GitHub platform to store the code and all the instructions. You can find all of it in using the following link: https://github.com/LukasGaud/LAT-Exp

Maybe it is the easiest if I just give you my account details to sign in to GitHub. They are:

Username: LukasGaud
Password: Controlgroup1

Alternatively, we can create a gitHub account for you and give you access to the repository.

If you had time, please do not hesitate to let me know if you would like me to talk you through some of the instructions and setting some of the procedure up today, to make everything easier tomorrow.

Many thanks,
Lukas
